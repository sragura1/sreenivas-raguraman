 abstract = {Magnesium alloysMagnesium alloys (Mg alloys) offer immense potential as intelligent alternatives to traditional implant materials due to their inherent degradability, biocompatibility, and exceptional mechanical propertiesMechanical Properties. However, their rapid deterioration hinders their practical applications, compromising their mechanical integrity. This study addresses this challenge by investigating the effects of thermo-mechanical processingThermo-mechanical Processing, including extrusion, cECAP, rolling, and annealing, on the high-strength, dilute ZX10 Mg alloy. By subjecting the alloy to over thirty processing conditions, we identify an optimal combination of high-strength and low-corrosion ratesCorrosion Rate. Simple characterizationCharacterization techniques like XRD, optical microscopy, and SEM were employed to rapidly evaluate the microstructural changes post-processing. The findings identify that grain boundary and strain hardening play pivotal roles in enhancing hardness, while factors such as textureTexture, dislocationDislocation density, and precipitates impact corrosionCorrosion significantly. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into processingProcessing-structure–property relationships for Mg alloysMagnesium alloys (Mg alloys), paving the way for developing superior biodegradable implant materials.},
