abstract: Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys are gaining attention for biomedical
  implants due to their favorable mechanical properties and safe degradation within
  the human body. However, the rapid corrosion of Mg remains a challenge, necessitating
  a deeper understanding of its behavior in physiological environments. This study
  examines the in-vitro corrosion performance of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloy in various
  degradation media, including Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), Earle’s Balanced
  Salt Solution (EBSS) buffered with 5% CO2, and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
  (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) buffered with 5% CO2. Significant differences
  in corrosion rates were observed across media, with HBSS exhibiting the lowest rates
  and EBSS the highest. DMEM with 10% FBS and corrosion conditions that most closely
  resemble physiological environments produced intermediate corrosion rates. The effect
  of CO2 buffering in HBSS was also evaluated, demonstrating enhanced pH control below
  7.5, which simulates physiological pH. Additionally, increasing the volume of HBSS,
  both with and without CO2 buffering, led to reduced corrosion rates and greater
  pH stabilization. These findings shed light on how testing conditions can impact
  corrosion rates and pH stability.
