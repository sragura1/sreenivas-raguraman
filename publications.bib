	abstract = {Medical application materials must meet multiple requirements, and the designed material must mimic the structure, shape. and support the formation of the replacing tissue. Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc alloys (Zn), as a “smart” biodegradable material and as “the green engineering material in the 21st century”, have become an outstanding implant material due to their natural degradability, smart biocompatibility, and desirable mechanical properties. Magnesium and Zinc are recognized as the next generation of cardiovascular stents and bioresorbable scaffolds. At the same time, improving the properties and corrosion resistance of these alloys is an urgent challenge. particularly to promote the application of magnesium alloys. A relatively fast deterioration rate of magnesium-based materials generally results in premature mechanical integrity compromise and local hydrogen build-up, resulting in restricted applicability. This review article aims to give a comprehensive comparison between Zn-based alloys and Mg-based alloys, focusing primarily on degradation and biocompatibility for cardiovascular applications. The recent clinical trials using these biodegradable metals have also been addressed.},

	abstract = {Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their rapid in-vivo degradation presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical integrity over time. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature thermal processing on the mechanical and degradation attributes of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing rapid, cost-efficient characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy, we swiftly examine microstructural changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties and critical targets (properties): hardness and corrosion resistance. Additionally, leveraging the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we pinpoint the dominant microstructural factors among closely correlated variables. Our findings underscore the significant role of grain size refinement in strengthening and the predominance of the ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase in corrosion behavior. This suggests that achieving an optimal blend of strength and corrosion resistance is attainable through fine grains and reduced concentration of ternary phases. This thorough investigation furnishes valuable insights into the intricate interplay of processing, structure, and properties in magnesium alloys, thereby advancing the development of superior biodegradable implant materials.},

	abstract = {Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys are gaining attention for biomedical implants due to their favorable mechanical properties and safe degradation within the human body. However, the rapid corrosion of Mg remains a challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of its behavior in physiological environments. This study examines the in-vitro corrosion performance of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloy in various degradation media, including Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) buffered with 5\% CO2, and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10\% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) buffered with 5\% CO2. Significant differences in corrosion rates were observed across media, with HBSS exhibiting the lowest rates and EBSS the highest. DMEM with 10\% FBS and corrosion conditions that most closely resemble physiological environments produced intermediate corrosion rates. The effect of CO2 buffering in HBSS was also evaluated, demonstrating enhanced pH control below 7.5, which simulates physiological pH. Additionally, increasing the volume of HBSS, both with and without CO2 buffering, led to reduced corrosion rates and greater pH stabilization. These findings shed light on how testing conditions can impact corrosion rates and pH stability.},
