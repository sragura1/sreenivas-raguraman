abstract: 'Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional
  orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability, biocompatibility,
  and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their rapid in-vivo degradation
  presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical integrity over time. This study
  investigates the impact of high-temperature thermal processing on the mechanical
  and degradation attributes of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing rapid, cost-efficient
  characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy, we swiftly
  examine microstructural changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation
  coefficient analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties
  and critical targets (properties): hardness and corrosion resistance. Additionally,
  leveraging the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we pinpoint
  the dominant microstructural factors among closely correlated variables. Our findings
  underscore the significant role of grain size refinement in strengthening and the
  predominance of the ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase in corrosion behavior. This suggests
  that achieving an optimal blend of strength and corrosion resistance is attainable
  through fine grains and reduced concentration of ternary phases. This thorough investigation
  furnishes valuable insights into the intricate interplay of processing, structure,
  and properties in magnesium alloys, thereby advancing the development of superior
  biodegradable implant materials.'
