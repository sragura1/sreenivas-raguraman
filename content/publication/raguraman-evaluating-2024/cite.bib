 abstract = {Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys are gaining attention for biomedical implants due to their favorable mechanical properties and safe degradation within the human body. However, the rapid corrosion of Mg remains a challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of its behavior in physiological environments. This study examines the in-vitro corrosion performance of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloy in various degradation media, including Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) buffered with 5% CO2, and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) buffered with 5% CO2. Significant differences in corrosion rates were observed across media, with HBSS exhibiting the lowest rates and EBSS the highest. DMEM with 10% FBS and corrosion conditions that most closely resemble physiological environments produced intermediate corrosion rates. The effect of CO2 buffering in HBSS was also evaluated, demonstrating enhanced pH control below 7.5, which simulates physiological pH. Additionally, increasing the volume of HBSS, both with and without CO2 buffering, led to reduced corrosion rates and greater pH stabilization. These findings shed light on how testing conditions can impact corrosion rates and pH stability.},
