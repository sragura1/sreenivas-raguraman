 abstract = {Medical application materials must meet multiple requirements, and the designed material must mimic the structure, shape. and support the formation of the replacing tissue. Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc alloys (Zn), as a “smart” biodegradable material and as “the green engineering material in the 21st century”, have become an outstanding implant material due to their natural degradability, smart biocompatibility, and desirable mechanical properties. Magnesium and Zinc are recognized as the next generation of cardiovascular stents and bioresorbable scaffolds. At the same time, improving the properties and corrosion resistance of these alloys is an urgent challenge. particularly to promote the application of magnesium alloys. A relatively fast deterioration rate of magnesium-based materials generally results in premature mechanical integrity compromise and local hydrogen build-up, resulting in restricted applicability. This review article aims to give a comprehensive comparison between Zn-based alloys and Mg-based alloys, focusing primarily on degradation and biocompatibility for cardiovascular applications. The recent clinical trials using these biodegradable metals have also been addressed.},
