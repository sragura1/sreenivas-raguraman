abstract: Magnesium alloysMagnesium alloys (Mg alloys) offer immense potential as
  intelligent alternatives to traditional implant materials due to their inherent
  degradability, biocompatibility, and exceptional mechanical propertiesMechanical
  Properties. However, their rapid deterioration hinders their practical applications,
  compromising their mechanical integrity. This study addresses this challenge by
  investigating the effects of thermo-mechanical processingThermo-mechanical Processing,
  including extrusion, cECAP, rolling, and annealing, on the high-strength, dilute
  ZX10 Mg alloy. By subjecting the alloy to over thirty processing conditions, we
  identify an optimal combination of high-strength and low-corrosion ratesCorrosion
  Rate. Simple characterizationCharacterization techniques like XRD, optical microscopy,
  and SEM were employed to rapidly evaluate the microstructural changes post-processing.
  The findings identify that grain boundary and strain hardening play pivotal roles
  in enhancing hardness, while factors such as textureTexture, dislocationDislocation
  density, and precipitates impact corrosionCorrosion significantly. This comprehensive
  investigation provides valuable insights into processingProcessing-structure–property
  relationships for Mg alloysMagnesium alloys (Mg alloys), paving the way for developing
  superior biodegradable implant materials.
