abstract: Medical application materials must meet multiple requirements, and the designed
  material must mimic the structure, shape. and support the formation of the replacing
  tissue. Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc alloys (Zn), as a “smart” biodegradable material
  and as “the green engineering material in the 21st century”, have become an outstanding
  implant material due to their natural degradability, smart biocompatibility, and
  desirable mechanical properties. Magnesium and Zinc are recognized as the next generation
  of cardiovascular stents and bioresorbable scaffolds. At the same time, improving
  the properties and corrosion resistance of these alloys is an urgent challenge.
  particularly to promote the application of magnesium alloys. A relatively fast deterioration
  rate of magnesium-based materials generally results in premature mechanical integrity
  compromise and local hydrogen build-up, resulting in restricted applicability. This
  review article aims to give a comprehensive comparison between Zn-based alloys and
  Mg-based alloys, focusing primarily on degradation and biocompatibility for cardiovascular
  applications. The recent clinical trials using these biodegradable metals have also
  been addressed.
